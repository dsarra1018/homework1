Homework 1: HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## About Code Refactor

This is my attempt at refactoring an existing code. I added alt attributes into img elements in order to met certain set of standards. I made it more accesible for those who are visual impaired. I also updated the HTML elements sementically to allow browsers to identify each element's functionality. By updating the HTML elements, I was able to clean up the links in the CSS.
